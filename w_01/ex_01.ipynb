    "Suppose that you have 8 cards. 5 of them are green ($G$) and 3 are yellow ($Y$). The five $G$ cards are numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The three $Y$ cards are numbered 1, 2, 3. The cards are well shuffled. You randomly draw 1 card. Denote with $E$ the event of drawing an even-numbered card, and compute.\n",

    "4.  $P(G \\vee E)$\n",
    "5.  Are $G$ and $E$ mutually exclusive?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution 1: *Counting frenzy*\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire problem *could* be solved with no more than counting and the computation of ratios. Indeed, being the event set (the set of all possible outcomes we could witness in repeatedly *experiencing* the situation described until a fixed point is reached) discrete and finite, we can fall-back to the Laplacian *common-sense based* approach to probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we are interested in the event of drawing 1 card from a finite deck composed of cards satisfying the properties described before. The set of all possible events we can witness (and therefore think of) has as elements each and all the events of *extracting one specific card* of the deck, among all of them. Its cardinality is easily computed as $|\\Omega| = 8$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the two properties $G$ (whose opposite $¬G = Y$) and $E$ (whose opposite $¬E = O$) are sufficient to univocally identify the cards of the deck (by replacing the number of each given-colour card with its *even*/*odd* specification, eventually indexed to preserve distinguishability), so are the events of the event set.\n",
    "I.e.: $\\Omega := \\{\\text{1G, 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G, 1Y, 2Y, 3Y}\\} = {\\{\\text{OG, EG, OG', EG', OG'', OY, EY, OY'}\\}}$. In such description, the juxtaposition of property specifiers ($G$, $Y$, $E$, $O$) denotes that both properties are satisfied; meaning that e.g. $OY \\equiv (O \\wedge Y)$ and the presence of a given index (or lack thereof) specifies that the event is distinguishable from all others identified by the same pair of properties (which they satisfy) but a different index.\n",
    "\n",
    "By acknowledging that $p(\\text{property}) = p(e\\ \\text{s.t.}\\ \\text{property}(e)\\ \\text{is true}) = \\frac{\\#\\ e \\in \\Omega\\ \\text{s.t.}\\ \\text{property}(e)\\ \\text{is true}}{\\#\\ e \\in \\Omega} = \\frac{|\\Omega_{\\text{property}}|}{|\\Omega|}$, points (i), (iii) and (iv) are directly solvable by counting the specific events satisfying the proposed property (or their conjunction / disjunction) and dividing the result by $|\\Omega|$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Point (ii) can be solved by acknowledging that, in the Laplacian approach to probability, the conditioning set contains the truth condition that defines the (new) event set to consider. In our case, conditioning on $E$ is equivalent to redefining the event set as $\\Omega_E$ and then computing $p(\\text{property}| E) = \\frac{|\\Omega_{\\text{property}|E}|}{|\\Omega_E|}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Point (v) is solved by noticing that $|\\Omega_{G \\wedge E}| >0$ (meaning that the events are not mutually exclusive).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution 2: *Three numbers suffice*\n",
    "\n",
    "At the totally opposite end of the spectrum there is the approach consisting in counting the *least possible* in order to solve all the possible problems involving the situation just described. What follows could be even performed without knowing which specific questions we will be going to answer afterwards. The counting procedure is the same as before, but it is performed just *w.r.t.* the four properties $G\\wedge E$, $G\\wedge O$, $Y\\wedge E$, $Y\\wedge O$, thus leading to the corresponding probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of one (of the four) property could even be computed from the remaining three, via normalization, i.e. $p(\\Omega)=1$. Such three numbers (to be obtained by counting) fully describe the outcome-generating process *w.r.t.* the properties we are interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process just described is indeed the construction of a probability mass function of the event *draw of a card from the deck* according to the two coordinates *even or odd* and *green or yellow*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probabilities involving just one among all (two) properties can be computed by marginalizing (i.e. summing over all possible values of) the other variable(s); unions of events can be reduced to set-theoretical operations involving negations of single properties and intersections – or just by exploiting the weak version of disjointness axiom (even pre-dating Kolmogorov’s) *a.t.w.* $p(¬A) = 1-p(A)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditioning is performed via quotient of probabilities, i.e. $p(A|B) = \\frac{p(A\\wedge B)}{p(B)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Point (v) is addressed by noticing that $p(G\\wedge E)>0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The actual solution: putting numbers in\n",
    "\n",
    "Either way they are computed (or in a mix of them):\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  $P(G)= \\frac{5}{3+5}=\\frac{5}{8}$. E.g. via direct plug-in of numbers given by the text.\n",
    "2.  $P(G|E) = \\frac{P(G\\wedge E)}{P(E)} = \\frac{2/8}{3/8} = \\frac{2}{3}$. E.g. via definition of conditional probability. Counting is used to determine:\n",
    "3.  $P(G\\wedge E) = \\frac{2}{8} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n",
    "4.  $P(G \\vee E) = 1-P(Y\\wedge O) = 1-\\frac{2}{8} = \\frac{3}{4}$. E.g. $P(Y\\wedge O)$ via counting.\n",

    "### Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem can be easily solved when mapped to an *urns and balls sampling problem*, where $n$ balls – $m$ red and $(n-m)$ black – are put inside an urn. The probability $p_?$ to be determined is that of extracting, twice and without replacement, at least one red ball. The order of extraction is irrelevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most straightforward way to attack the problem is to consider the complementary event (i.e. extracting – in the same setting as before – exactly two black balls), and then compute $p_? = 1-p_{BB}$. This way, both the problem of draw order and that of asymmetry between first and second draw due to lack of replacement are solved. *For free!*\n",
